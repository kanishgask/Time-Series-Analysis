# Time-Series-Analysis

**Monthly Sales Time Series Analysis**
This project demonstrates how to analyze and visualize monthly sales data using Python. It includes time series decomposition, autocorrelation analysis, and rolling statistics to explore trends and seasonality in the data.

**Features**
Generates synthetic monthly sales data from January 2020 to December 2023.

Visualizes sales data over time.

Performs additive seasonal decomposition to extract trend, seasonality, and residual components.

Plots autocorrelation to identify patterns and dependencies.

Computes and plots rolling mean and rolling standard deviation to assess stationarity.

**Requirements**
Python 3.x

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

statsmodels

You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels
**Usage**
Run the Python script to generate synthetic sales data.

Visualize the original data with a time series plot.

Perform and visualize seasonal decomposition.

Examine autocorrelation with an ACF plot.

Calculate and plot rolling statistics for trend analysis.

**Code Overview**
pandas and numpy are used for data manipulation and generation.

matplotlib handles plotting.

statsmodels provides tools for time series decomposition and autocorrelation analysis.

**Future Work**
Implement forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet).

Add stationarity tests (ADF, KPSS).

Use real sales data for practical applications.
